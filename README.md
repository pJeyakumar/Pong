# PONG
Written and developped by Piranavan Jeyakumar, Front-End graphics mostly provided, completely in C# using the NetBeans IDE.

Compete against a CPU in a 2D Ping Pong style game! Use your paddle and the game's border's to bounce the ball to the opponent's side! With every hit the ball gets progressively faster!

Goal: First to two points wins the round!

The more rounds you win, the faster the CPU's paddle becomes, so get ready to deal with GOD-LIKE reflexes.
